# E-Commerce Price Tracker

This mini Project is a high utility application which can be used to Track prices on E-Commerce websites (like Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, etc.) of the products which you long to buy but the prices seem just too high :(

I have built this application using **Python** and as an example I have taken a product from _[Amazon] (https://www.amazon.in)_. 

>**_Note_**: _Not all websites allow web scraping. Therefore, please check about the website before proceeding with it._

## Running the Application

`python scraper.py`
